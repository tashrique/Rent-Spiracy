## üîÑ System Overview

USER FLOW - 
a user comes in first, and the FIRST thing they see popped up is language, and once they select language, every thing fromthen on will be in that lagnauge, the output too. however we re going to have only 3 hardcoded languages english chinese and spanish and hindi and once they select, the language, the interface appears inthat lagnuage and then there is liek a form of renters email or phone or url of listing or address and a file upload to upload lease aggreements. then we parse the pdf and send to backend. the link does a google search and the other info looks for information on the FAKE db we will be having. we will have a google search to find the zillow or craigslist listing but we will get a random terms and conditions and report on that address from a fakeDB  and al lthat information will be passed to gemini including the parsed lease. and then gemini wil lsend to backend the response, scam likeliness, to backend in the language the user specified, maybe strutured output will be good here, backend will send to frontend, if scam likely, backend will flag it in the Database(fakedb) and if the user wants speaking, the backend will send it to elevenlabs to speak in that language (elevenlabs part is stretch faeture but the rest is main feature.)
